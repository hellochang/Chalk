# Publication
Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, 
you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, 
**Google Drive**,
**WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control
over what you export.

> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.
